# `git diff` is a Git command used to display the differences between two states of your project. 
# It lets you see what has changed in your code — line by line — before committing those changes. 
# When you run `git diff` without options, it shows the unstaged modifications in your working directory compared to the last committed version.
# If you use `git diff --staged` (or `--cached`), it shows the changes that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed.
# You can also use `git diff` to compare two commits, branches, or specific files by specifying their names or hashes,
# such as `git diff main feature-branch` or `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD`. This command is especially helpful for reviewing edits,
# debugging issues, or understanding how your code has evolved over time. In short,
# `git diff` is an essential tool for inspecting changes before you commit or push them to a remote repository.
